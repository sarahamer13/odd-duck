# odd-duck

Odd Duck Product Co is trying to decide which project from their R&D department they should invest in next to sell.

This web page will run at a kiosk at the front entrance of the campus. Whenever an employee walks by, the employee can vote for 1 of the 3 products displayed that they think should be the next new product brought to market. After a week of collecting data, Odd Duck company will display nice graphs to visualize the results.
